    "### Let's break down the problem step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the Problem:\n",
    "- The problem asks us to implement two functions: serialize and deserialize for a binary tree.\n",
    "- Serialization means converting the binary tree into a string representation.\n",
    "- Deserialization means reconstructing the binary tree from its string representation.\n",
    "- We're given a Node class representing each node in the binary tree.\n",
    "- We need to ensure that after serializing and then deserializing a binary tree, it remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Serialization (serialize function):\n",
    "- Serialization is the process of converting a data structure into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted.\n",
    "- In this case, we're converting a binary tree into a string.\n",
    "- We'll use a preorder traversal technique to visit nodes in the order root-left-right.\n",
    "- During traversal, we'll append each node's value to a string, separating values by commas.\n",
    "- If a node is None (i.e., no child), we'll represent it as 'X'.\n",
    "- The result string represents the serialized binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Deserialization (deserialize function):\n",
    "- Deserialization is the process of reconstructing a data structure from its serialized format.\n",
    "- In this case, we're reconstructing a binary tree from its string representation.\n",
    "- We'll use a queue to process the serialized string.\n",
    "- We'll define a recursive helper function to construct the tree.\n",
    "- At each step, we dequeue a value from the string:\n",
    "- If the value is 'X', it represents a null node, so we return None.\n",
    "- Otherwise, we create a node with that value and recursively call the helper function to construct its left and right 4. subtrees.\n",
    "- Finally, the root of the reconstructed tree is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Testing:\n",
    "- After implementing serialization and deserialization, it's essential to test whether the functions work correctly.\n",
    "- We create a binary tree, serialize it, then deserialize it back to a tree.\n",
    "- We verify if the deserialized tree matches the original tree by accessing specific nodes and comparing their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Implementation:\n",
    "- We implement the serialize and deserialize functions according to the described logic.\n",
    "- We use a Node class to represent each node in the binary tree.\n",
    "- The serialize function takes the root of the tree and returns the serialized string.\n",
    "- The deserialize function takes the serialized string and returns the root of the reconstructed tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Optimization and Complexity:\n",
    "- We aim for the best possible time and space complexity in our implementation.\n",
    "- Preorder traversal ensures that each node is visited exactly once during serialization and deserialization, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",
    "- Space complexity primarily depends on the recursion depth during deserialization, which is O(n) in the worst case.\n",
    "- By understanding and following these steps, we can effectively solve the problem of serializing and deserializing a binary tree."
