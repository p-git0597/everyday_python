    "To determine whether a 32-bit positive integer N is a power of four in faster than O(log N) time, we can use bit manipulation techniques. A 32-bit integer has at most 32 bits, and a power of four has only one bit set in even position (0-indexed) and is greater than zero. For example, 4 (100 in binary), 16 (10000 in binary), 64 (1000000 in binary), etc., are powers of four."
