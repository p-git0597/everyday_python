    "### minimum cost to paint the houses\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem was asked by Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "A builder is looking to build a row of N houses that can be of K different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an N by K matrix where the nth row and kth column represents the cost to build the nth house with kth color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal."

    "# Steps for Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Define State Variables:\n",
    "Let `dp[i][j]` represent the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses, with the `i`-th house painted with the `j`-th color.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Base Case:\n",
    "For the first house, the cost is simply the cost of painting it with the given color. Hence, for each `j` (color), `dp[0][j] = cost[0][j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Transition:\n",
    "For each subsequent house, we need to minimize the cost while ensuring that no two adjacent houses are painted the same color. Hence, for each house `i` and each color `j`, we calculate the minimum cost as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "dp[i][j] = cost[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][m] for all m â‰  j)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the cost to paint house i with color j is the cost of painting house i with color j plus the minimum of the costs for the previous house with any color except j.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Final Solution:\n",
    "Once all houses are painted, the answer is the minimum value from the last row of the dp table (i.e., min(dp[N-1])), since we are trying to find the minimum total cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Optimizations:\n",
    "To improve space complexity, we can reduce the storage to O(K) instead of O(N*K) by keeping track of only the costs for the current and previous houses."
