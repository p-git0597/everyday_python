    "## Maximum Sum of Non-Adjacent Numbers #9 [Hard]\n",

    "\n",
    "- Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]` should return `13`, since we pick `2`, `6`, and `5`. `[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return 10, since we pick `5` and `5`.\n",

    "## Logic:\n",
    "- We use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently in O(N) time and constant space.\n",
    "- We maintain two variables: incl to represent the maximum sum including the current number, and excl to represent the maximum sum excluding the current number.\n",
    "- We iterate through the list of numbers, and for each number, we update incl and excl accordingly based on the previous values.\n",
    "- At each step, we calculate the new maximum sum including the current number (new_incl) by adding the current number to the previous maximum sum excluding the current number (excl).\n",
    "- We then update excl to be the maximum of the previous incl and excl, and incl to be the new maximum sum including the current number (new_incl).\n",
    "- Finally, we return the maximum of the final incl and excl as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm:\n",
    "- Initialize incl and excl variables to 0.\n",
    "- Iterate through the list of numbers.\n",
    "- For each number:\n",
    "    - Calculate the new maximum sum including the current number (new_incl) by adding the current number to the previous maximum sum excluding the current number (excl).\n",
    "    - Update excl to be the maximum of the previous incl and excl.\n",
    "    - Update incl to be the new maximum sum including the current number (new_incl).\n",
    "- Return the maximum of the final incl and excl as the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation with Example:\n",
    "Let's take the example [2, 4, 6, 2, 5]:\n",
    "- Initially, incl and excl are both 0.\n",
    "- When we encounter the first number 2, incl becomes 2 (2 is the maximum sum including 2) and excl remains 0.\n",
    "- When we encounter the second number 4, new_incl becomes 4 (2 + 2), excl becomes 2 (maximum of 2 and 0), and incl becomes 4.\n",
    "- When we encounter the third number 6, new_incl becomes 8 (2 + 6), excl becomes 4 (maximum of 4 and 2), and incl becomes 8.\n",
    "- When we encounter the fourth number 2, new_incl becomes 6 (4 + 2), excl becomes 8 (maximum of 8 and 4), and incl becomes 6.\n",
    "- When we encounter the fifth number 5, new_incl becomes 13 (8 + 5), excl becomes 8 (maximum of 8 and 6), and incl becomes 13.\n",
    "- Finally, the maximum sum is the maximum of incl and excl, which is 13."
