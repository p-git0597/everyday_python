    "1. Understanding the Problem:\n",
    "- We're given a mapping where each letter corresponds to a number (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26).\n",
    "- The task is to count the number of ways an encoded message can be decoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Approach:\n",
    "- We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem.\n",
    "- We'll define a dynamic programming array dp, where dp[i] represents the number of ways to decode the string s[:i].\n",
    "- We initialize dp[0] to 1 to handle the base case. We also set dp[1] to 1 if the first character of s is not '0'.\n",
    "- We iterate through the characters of the string starting from index 2:\n",
    "    - If the current character is not '0', we add dp[i - 1] to dp[i] because we can decode it as a single character.\n",
    "    - If the last two characters form a number between 10 and 26 (inclusive), we add dp[i - 2] to dp[i] because we can decode them as a pair.\n",
    "- The final answer will be dp[n], where n is the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Time Complexity:\n",
    "- We iterate through the string once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Space Complexity:\n",
    "- We use an additional array of size n+1 for dynamic programming, so the space complexity is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Example and Logic:\n",
    "- For the example message '111':\n",
    "    - We have three ways to decode it: 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.\n",
    "    - We use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to decode the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently counts the number of ways to decode an encoded message using dynamic programming."
