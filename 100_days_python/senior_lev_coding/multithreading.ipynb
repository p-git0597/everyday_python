    "## Multithreading in Python\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique in programming that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process. In Python, we can use the threading module to implement multithreading. In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at the threading module and its various functions and how they can be used in Python.\n",

    "### Creating a thread\n",
    "To create a thread, we need to create a Thread object and then call its start() method. The start() method runs the thread and then to stop the execution, we use the join() method. Here's how we can create a simple thread."
