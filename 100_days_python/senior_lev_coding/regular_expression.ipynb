    "## Regular Expressions in Python\n",
    "Regular expressions, or \"regex\" for short, are a powerful tool for working with strings and text data in Python. They allow you to match and manipulate strings based on patterns, making it easy to perform complex string operations with just a few lines of code.\n",

    "```\n",

    "### Importing re Package\n",
    "In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. The basic syntax for working with regular expressions in Python is as follows:\n",

    "`import re`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Searching for a pattern in re using re.search() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "re.search() method either returns None (if the pattern doesnâ€™t match), or a re.MatchObject that contains information about the matching part of the string. This method stops after the first match, so this is best suited for testing a regular expression more than extracting data. We can use re.search method like this to search for a pattern in regular expression:"
