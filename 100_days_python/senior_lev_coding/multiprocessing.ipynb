    "## Multiprocessing in Python\n",
    "Multiprocessing is a Python module that provides a simple way to run multiple processes in parallel. It allows you to take advantage of multiple cores or processors on your system and can significantly improve the performance of your code. In this repl, we'll take a closer look at the multiprocessing module and its various functions and how they can be used in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `multiprocessing.Process(target, args)`: This function creates a new process that runs the target function with the specified arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `multiprocessing.Pool(processes)`: This function creates a pool of worker processes that can be used to parallelize the execution of a function across multiple input values.\n",

    "- `multiprocessing.Queue()`: This function creates a queue that can be used to communicate data between processes.\n",
