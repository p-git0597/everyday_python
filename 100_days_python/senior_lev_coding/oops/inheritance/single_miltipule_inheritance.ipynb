    "## Single Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Single inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits properties and behaviors from a single parent class. This is the simplest and most common form of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "The syntax for single inheritance in Python is straightforward and easy to understand. To create a new class that inherits from a parent class, simply specify the parent class in the class definition, inside the parentheses, like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # class body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of single inheritance in Python. Consider a class named \"Animal\" that contains the attributes and behaviors that are common to all animals.\n"

    "## Multiple Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. This can be useful in situations where a class needs to inherit functionality from multiple sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "In Python, multiple inheritance is implemented by specifying multiple parent classes in the class definition, separated by commas.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass1, ParentClass2, ParentClass3):\n",
    "    # class body\n",
    "```\n",

    "In this example, the `ChildClass` inherits attributes and methods from all three parent classes: `ParentClass1`, `ParentClass2`, and `ParentClass3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that, in case of multiple inheritance, Python follows a `method resolution order (MRO)` to resolve conflicts between methods or attributes from different parent classes. The MRO determines the order in which parent classes are searched for attributes and methods."
