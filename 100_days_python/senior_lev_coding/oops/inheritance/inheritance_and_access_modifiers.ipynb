    "## Inheritance in python\n",
    "When a class derives from another class. The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods, this is called as inheritance.\n",

    "```\n",
    "class BaseClass:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Derived class inherits features from the base class where new features can be added to it. This results in re-usability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of inheritance in Python:\n",
    "1. Single inheritance - (Deriving from one parent) - `class DerivedClass(BaseClass)`\n",
    "2. Multiple inheritance - (Deriving from more than one parents) - `class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2)`(also known as or diamond problem)\n",
    "3. Multiple inheritance - (Deriving from more than one parent) - `class DerivedClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2)`\n",
    "4. Multilevel inheritance - (More than two parents)\n",
    "5. Hierarchical Inheritance - (A class inherits from another class which itself is derived from a third class)\n",
    "6. Hybrid inheritance - (Combination of single and multiple inheritance)\n"

This is known as a \"weak internal use indicator\" and it is a convention only, not a strict rule. Code outside the class can still access these \"private\" variables and methods, but it is generally understood that they should not be accessed or modified."

For example, if a class has a method called _my_method, it is indicating that the method should only be accessed by the class itself and its subclasses.\n",
