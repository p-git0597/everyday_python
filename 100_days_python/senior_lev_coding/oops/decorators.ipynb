    "## Python Decorators\n",
    "Python decorators are a powerful and versatile tool that allow you to modify the behavior of functions and methods. They are a way to extend the functionality of a function or method without modifying its source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that modifies the behavior of the original function. The new function is often referred to as a \"decorated\" function. The basic syntax for using a decorator is the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "@decorator_function\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "The @decorator_function notation is just a shorthand for the following code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "my_function = decorator_function(my_function)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Decorators are often used to add functionality to functions and methods, such as logging, memoization, and access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical use case\n",
    "One common use of decorators is to add logging to a function. For example, you could use a decorator to log the arguments and return value of a function each time it is called:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "def log_function_call(func):\n",
    "    def decorated(*args, **kwargs):\n",
    "        logging.info(f\"Calling {func.__name__} with args={args}, kwargs={kwargs}\")\n",
    "        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "        logging.info(f\"{func.__name__} returned {result}\")\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "    return decorated\n",
    "@log_function_call\n",
    "def my_function(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the log_function_call decorator takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that logs the function call before and after the original function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Decorators are a powerful and flexible feature in Python that can be used to add functionality to functions and methods without modifying their source code. They are a great tool for separating concerns, reducing code duplication, and making your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, python decorators are a way to extend the functionality of functions and methods, by modifying its behavior without modifying the source code. They are used for a variety of purposes, such as logging, memoization, access control, and more. They are a powerful tool that can be used to make your code more readable, maintainable, and extendable."
