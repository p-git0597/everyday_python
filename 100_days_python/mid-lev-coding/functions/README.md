Why do we need function:-

1. To organize our code in a more manageable way.
2. Reusability: Functions allow us to write the same piece of code multiple times with
   different inputs, making it easier to maintain and modify our program as we add features or fix bugs
3. Readability: Functions make our code self-explanatory by giving them meaningful
   names that describe what they do. This makes it easier for other developers (and ourselves) to understand
   what each part of the code does.
4. Modularity: By breaking down our code into functions, we can work on different parts
   of the program independently without having to read through the entire project.
5. Debugging: When something goes wrong in our code, instead of searching through
   hundreds of lines of code, we can use functions to narrow down where the issue is coming
   from.
6. Performance: If certain tasks are performed repeatedly within a system, rather than performing the task
   every time the main routine runs, these tasks should be placed inside a function and called when needed
   so that the computer doesn't have to spend extra cycles doing the same thing over and over.
7. Efficiency: If certain tasks are performed repeatedly throughout our codebase,
   placing those tasks inside a function saves time and resources by avoiding redundant operations.

Functions are particularly useful when working on large projects where dependencies between modules are complex.
